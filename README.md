# codewars-challenges
Find each Codewars kyu in three folders, containing HTML documents containing links to the challenges in ascending difficulty.

Codewars isn't very good at assigning challenges that are suitable to one's skill levels.

While committing yourself to completing a difficult task is part of what it means to be a programmer, this graded list of challenges will help the beginner to get the much needed practice.

There are 8 kyus in Codewars, the easiest being 8kyu and the most difficult being 1kyu.
Each kyu receives three separate folders, Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.
The difficult level of each kyu can vary greatly, hence the progressive classification of Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.

Let me know what I can do to improve this list!
